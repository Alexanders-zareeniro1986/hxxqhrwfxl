Whoa. Just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and man, I have sooo many thoughts, like someone opened a floodgate. First off, what was that with the sirens? I'm still not sure if I loved or hated them. Was I the only one who thought the CGI was a bit... you know, meh? I mean, sometimes I’m just like, Do I stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 or just roll with it? 🤷‍♀️

Geralt was, of course, a complete mood as always! But like, did he even sleep at all in this one? Maybe it's just me being tired, but he looked like my reflection after pulling an all-nighter on a design project. But seriously, I really need to maybe consider 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   for a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 because I missed some parts—and you KNOW I can't imagine living with unanswered plot holes. Lol.

> So, can we talk about the interior design of those underwater caves? Honestly, I'm kinda vibing with the rock-and-pearl aesthetic. Not sure how practical that'd be in a real house, but a girl can dream, right? Let's just pretend I could somehow make pearl walls work in an earthly setting. Magic, maybe?

And did you see how they styled Yennefer this time? Those outfits were on point, though a bit much for grocery shopping IRL, haha! But I'm not gonna lie, I’d still want to try pulling that off, at least once. It's like those fashion-forward sirens were ready to hit the runway and the battlefield simultaneously. I almost forgot why I wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in the first place—too busy checking out the costumes.

Didn’t you feel like the plot was all over the place? Or was it just my brain going where’s my coffee 𝘮𝘰𝘥e? It was like one minute we're fighting sea monsters, the next we're sipping elixirs that look like they should be on my paint palette. Which, tbh, sometimes seems more organized than the script.

console.log(Why did I even add this line here?);

Anywho, if you haven’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 this one yet, you definitely should. Just don't blame me if you end up dreaming about sirens redecorating your apartment. 😂 Maybe it's just the sleep deprivation talking, but I think I might need to mix in some ocean vibes for my next project. Gotta keep it witchy and whimsical, you know? 🌊
